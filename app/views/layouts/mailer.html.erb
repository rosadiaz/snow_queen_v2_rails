    <br>
    <small>This is an agreement between the client, which is the customer that was generated through shovelsquad.ca website, and
      Shovel Squad Winter Services Inc. for Snow Removal and/or Salting Services. From this point forward, Shovel Squad Winter
      Services Inc. will be references as Shovel Squad and the property owners, customer, tenant or person who is paying for our
      services, will be referenced as the client.<br><br>
      <b>1.</b> I agree to pay Shovel Squad the quoted price which was generated by calculating square footage, salt sale and
      dispatch time, through shovelsquad.ca for snow clearing and salting services on the designated area. This area has been
      selected by the client and approved by Shovel Squad.<br>
      <b>2.</b> Changes in weather conditions are considered to be an “Act of God” and Shovel Squad assumes no liability as such.
      This includes and is not limited to snow, freezing, traffic conditions due to weather. The requested dispatch time is only a
      request and not guaranteed.<br>
      <b>3.</b> Shovel Squad will do its best to always source salt and deicing materials but cannot control salt shortages due to
      natural disasters, inclement weather or supplier chain shortages. If this was to occur, Shovel Squad will attempt to source from
      alternate sources but there may be a change to pricing due to demand. If there is no salt available, Shovel Squad is not liable.<br>
      <b>4.</b> Shovel Squad will exercise reasonable care to avoid damage to pavement, curbs, trees and shrubs. However,
      Shovel Squad is not responsible for any: A) damage to landscaping caused by the piling of snow. B) Damage to items that are
      snow-covered or not visible. C) Damage caused by equipment when tree, shrub and sidewalk areas are not reasonably
      delineated due to snow accumulation. D) Damage caused to pavement, sidewalks, pathways due to the use of salt or de-icing
      agent.<br>
      <b>5.</b> The owner will report, in writing to contact@shovelsquad.ca, any property damage caused by the Shovel Squad
      within 48 hours so Shovel Squad can investigate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Shovel Squad will have no
      obligation, and the owner waives any damages for any property damage not timely and properly reported.<br>
      <b>6.</b> Indemnification. The client, owners, guests, or any third party that comes on your premises shall indemnify,
      defend and hold harmless the contractor, its owners, employees and subcontractors from and against any and all claims,
      damages, attorney’s fees, costs and expenses which the contractor incurs as a result of a claim or claims brought by the client,
      owners or any third party, arising out of any wrongdoing, negligence and/or breach of contract by the client or owner alleged or
      otherwise, or any Act of God, including but not limited to extraordinary weather conditions, that is related, in any manner
      whatsoever, to the premises or the clients involvement with the premises or the services, including but not limited to personal
      injuries resulting from the slip and fall accidents.<br>
      <b>7.</b> The client is aware that shoveling or plowing may not clear their property to bare pavements and that slippery
      conditions may prevail even after doing so. Shovel Squad assumes no responsibility for slip and fall accidents or vehicular
      accidents as a result of this condition.<br>
      <b>8.</b> Shovel Squad will not shovel, plow or sand/salt within 4 feet from any parked vehicles, equipment or other
      obstructions in parking lots, driveways or other areas being cleared. Please attempt to move obstructions prior to the
      commencement of our services. In the case of damage due to items not being marked or moved, Shovel Squad is not liable.<br>
      <b>9.</b> Payment is due before services are rendered. In the case that there is a reversal of charges on your credit card, the
      client will be responsible for all costs of collection, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees in
      the event that it becomes necessary for Shovel Squad to resort to legal measures to collect any amount owed under this
      agreement.<br>
      <b>10.</b> The client waives their right to pursue legal action against Shovel Squad for any liability or damage relating to third
      party negligence, slip and fall or any other matter. The client will hold harmless Shovel Squad, its owners, employees,
      contractors and affiliates in the case of damages, slip and fall, injury or death.<br><br>
      <b>Disclaimer:<br>
      Shovel Squad is not liable for damage to pavement or other surfaces contracted for clearing of snow or salting. Depressed
      areas in pavement may accumulate snow that will not be removed as well as snow that has been packed down by vehicle or
      foot traffic. Remember, icy and slippery conditions may exist even after work is completed. Shovel Squad is not responsible
      however, for any death, injury, loss or damage of or to persons or property by reason of services being delayed or not
      performed due to circumstances beyond our control.</b><br><br>
      I have read and understand this document and disclaimer and agree to abide by the terms listed and hereby enter into
      contract with Shovel Squad Winter Services Inc. for the purposes listed above.
